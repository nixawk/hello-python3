# A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds

# One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than
# it is written. The guidelines provided here are intended to improve
# the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum
# of Python code. As PEP 20 says, "Readability counts".

# A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide
# is important. Consistency with a project is more important. Consistency
# within one module or function is the most important.

# However, know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes style guide recommendations
# just aren't applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at
# other examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask!

# In particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with this PEP !

# Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline:
    # 1. When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, 
    #    even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP.

    # 2. To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe
    #  for historic reasons) -- although this is also an opportunity to
    #  clean up someone else's mess (in true XP style).

    # 3. Because the code in question predates the introduction of the
    #    guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying that code.

    # 4. When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of
    #    Python that don't support the feature recommended by the style guide.
